# Secure Federated Learning

## Overview
Data privacy is a critical concern in healthcare. This project enables hospitals to collaboratively train machine learning models for disease diagnosis without sharing sensitive patient data.

## Key Features
- **Differential Privacy:** Adds noise to gradients to prevent data leakage.
- **Secure Aggregation:** Uses multi-party computation to aggregate updates securely.
- **Robustness:** Resilient to poisoning attacks from malicious participants.

## Impact
This protocol has been deployed in a pilot study involving 5 hospitals, successfully training a model for pneumonia detection with accuracy comparable to centralized training.
