# ChronoLog: A High-Performance Storage Infrastructure for Activity and Log Workloads

**Latest Release:** ChronoLog 1.0.0 is now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/grc-iit/ChronoLog/releases/tag/1.0.0).

HPC applications generate more data than storage systems can handle, and it is becoming increasingly important to store activity (log) data generated by people and applications. ChronoLog is a hierarchical, distributed log store that leverages physical time to achieve log ordering and reduce contention while utilizing storage tiers to elastically scale the log capacity.

## Background

Modern application domains in science and engineering, from astrophysics to web services and financial computations generate massive amounts of data at unprecedented rates (reaching up to 7 TB/s). This trend stresses existing storage systems past their capability.

## Key Features

- **Total Ordering** - Uses physical time to distribute and order log data without explicit synchronization
- **High Concurrency** - Supports multiple-writers-multiple-readers (MWMR) access model
- **Capacity Scaling** - Utilizes multi-tiered storage for elastic capacity

## Architecture

ChronoLog uses a 3D data distribution model:
- **ChronoVisor** - Handles client connections and global time synchronization
- **ChronoKeeper** - Serves tail operations with distributed journal storage
- **ChronoStore** - Manages intermediate and backend storage resources
- **ChronoGrapher** - Real-time data streaming for persistence
- **ChronoPlayer** - Historical reads and replay operations
