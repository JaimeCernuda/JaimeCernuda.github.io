The main website has 5 pages, each with dark and light mode.

I have built some versions of it using Google Scratch, which provides the visual UI, which I have downloaded to @website_pages

There are 5 pages:
- Home
- Publications
- Projects
- CV
- BloG

The goal not is to take this and build this in to a REACTIVE website, using HTML, CSS, and react.

You can use for now placeholder images and text. But make the website reactive, maintain the theme, formatting, etc of the page, and always assume there will be more content, so do not setup for 3 projects, but for an unlimited ammount of projects.

Ideally I will want to deploy this website to GitHub pages, so that will be something to keep in mind. Ideally also, I would love if the content of the website could be extended/edited/etc from markdown, so next publication or project, I just add a new line to a markdown, and boom it shows there
