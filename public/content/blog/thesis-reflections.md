# Reflections on defending my thesis in the age of LLMs

The landscape of academic research is shifting rapidly. As I stood before the committee, I couldn't help but wonder how generative AI will reshape the very definition of original contribution in computer science doctorates.

## The New Standard

It used to be that writing the code was 80% of the battle. Now, with Copilot and GPT-4, the implementation details are becoming commoditized. The real value is shifting towards:

1. **Problem Formulation**: Asking the right questions.
2. **System Architecture**: Designing robust interactions between components.
3. **Evaluation**: Rigorous testing that goes beyond standard benchmarks.

## What this means for future PhDs

I believe we are entering an era where "solo" research will become much more ambitious. A single student can now build systems that previously required a team of engineers. This raises the bar for what constitutes a "contribution".

We must ensure that we are training students not just to code, but to *think* computationally and critically about the systems they build.
